# Styleguides

This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. 

### general good practice

* Name your variable properly to keep the code readable and avoid variable name like: `var`, `i`, `object`, `temp`.
* If the part of code you write have no performance problem please favor readability over performance.
* Try to avoid too long function or class and to split the logic into subset easy to reuse by other contributors. 

### Git Commit Messages

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger 
changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit"
    >
    > "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
