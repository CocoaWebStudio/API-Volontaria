    * There are many other channels available, check the channel list

## Getting Started

First of all, Volontaria is a test-driven project. That means that a **test must be written before coding a new feature**.

Volontaria's issues can be found in the [Volontaria Github Page](https://github.com/Volontaria). The issues are also listed on [Waffle](https://waffle.io/Volontaria). Feel free to pick one and start contributing!

**Don't forget to comment on the issue before you begin to work on it (or assign it to yourself if you're a member of the organization).**

**Before submitting any contribution, you should really read the next sections.**

Check out the [Quickstart](http://volontaria.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/Quickstart/) document to get you started in no time!


## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages
* Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit"
    >
    > "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."


* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux
    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS
    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows
    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings

### Python Styleguide

All Python must adhere to the [PEP8 Styleguide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008).

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.
  * We end multi-lines lists or dicts with a comma (
    ```
    mydict = {
      "key1": 1,
      "key2": 2,
      "key3": 3,
    }
    ```
    and not
    ```
    mydict = {
      "key1": 1,
      "key2": 2,
      "key3": 3
    }
    ```
  * When initializing an empty variable, use its type constructor
  ```
  mydict =  dict()
  mylist = list()
  myint = int()
  mybool = bool()
  etc.
  ```
  and not
  ```
  mydict = {}
  mylist = []
  etc.
  ```
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
